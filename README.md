### 2. FM Scoring & Segmentation
- **Frequency**: Total number of transactions per customer
- **Monetary**: Total spending per customer
- Used **percentile-based scoring** (scale: 1‚Äì3) for both F and M metrics
- Generated FM combinations (e.g., 33, 21, 12)
- Mapped FM scores to 4 behavioral segments:
  - **Champions**
  - **Potential Loyalists**
  - **Needs Attention**
  - **At Risk**

### 3. Demographic Profiling
- Cross-tabulated segment distribution by:
  - **Gender**

  - **Marital Status**
- Calculated **representation index** to detect over/under-representation in each group

### 4. Product Category Analysis

- Tracked which demographics favor which product types
- Flagged potential cross-sell and up-sell opportunities
